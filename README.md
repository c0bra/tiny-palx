# tiny-palx
Automatic UI Color Palette Generator (tiny version of palx)

This library is exactly the same as [palx](https://github.com/jxnblk/palx) except it swaps out [chroma.js](https://github.com/gka/chroma.js) for [tinycolor](https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor). The ends result is a library that's 5kB minified and gzipped vs 14kB.
